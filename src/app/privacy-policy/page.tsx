          <h2>Who we are</h2>
          <p>Our website address is: https://notesacademy.in.</p>

          <h2>Comments</h2>
          <p>
            When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and
            also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the
            Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available
            here: <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>. After approval
            of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
          </p>

          <h2>Media</h2>
          <p>
            If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS)
            included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies.
            These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another
            comment. These cookies will last for one year.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies.
            This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display
            choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember
            Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes
            no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
          </p>

          <h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2>
          <p>
            Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content
            from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
          </p>
          <p>
            These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor
            your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if
            you have an account and are logged in to that website.
          </p>

          <h2>Who we share your data with</h2>
          <p>If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.</p>

          <h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
          <p>
            If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize
            and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their
            user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot
            change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
          </p>

          <h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
          <p>
            If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the
            personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we
            erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for
            administrative, legal, or security purposes.
          </p>

          <h2>Where your data is sent</h2>
          <p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>

          <h2>Additional information</h2>
          <p>
            By visiting this Website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do
            not agree please do not use or access our Website.
          </p>
          <p>
            By mere use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in
            accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of
            Use.
          </p>

          <h2>Data collection & cookies</h2>
          <p>
            In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information
            about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we
            indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide
            information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Website. We may automatically track
            certain information about you based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use this information to do internal
            research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our
            users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL
            that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this
            URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use data collection devices such as “cookies” on certain pages of the Website to help analyse our web page
            flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. “Cookies” are small files placed on
            your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available
            through the use of a “cookie”.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also
            help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are “session cookies,” meaning
            that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to
            decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain
            features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, you may encounter “cookies” or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website that are
            placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.
          </p>

          <h2>Transactional data</h2>
          <p>If you choose to buy on the Website, we collect information about your buying behaviour.</p>
          <p>
            If you transact with us, we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit / debit
            card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment instrument details and tracking
            information from cheques or money orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card / debit card /
            other payment instrument details, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with us. While you can browse
            some sections of our Website without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order)
            do require registration. We do use your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders
            and your interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal
            information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal
            information to resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service; collect money; measure
            consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products,
            services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other
            criminal activity; enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise described to you at the time of
            collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyse demographic
            and profile data about our users’ activity on our Website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website.
            Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact
            information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor
            your experience at our Website, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in and to
            display content according to your preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may share personal information with our other corporate entities and affiliates to help detect and prevent
            identity theft, fraud and other potentially illegal acts; correlate related or multiple accounts to prevent
            abuse of our services; and to facilitate joint or co-branded services that you request where such services
            are provided by more than one corporate entity. Those entities and affiliates may not market to you as a
            result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-in.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
            disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. We may
            disclose personal information to law enforcement offices, third party rights owners, or others in the good
            faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond
            to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect
            the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.
          </p>
          <p>
            We and our affiliates will share / sell some or all of your personal information with another business entity
            should we (or our assets) plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity, or re-organization,
            amalgamation, restructuring of business. Should such a transaction occur that other business entity (or the
            new combined entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal
            information.
